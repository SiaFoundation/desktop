          # to find projects but we otherwise want to manage the projects in this
          # repo independently.
          # - 'version' also removes the workspaces key after so that the change
          # to package.json is not included in the changeset pull request.
          # - 'release' does not remove the workspaces key because this would
          # make changesets try to publish as a single package repo, and it does
          # not commit the file anyway.
